# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repository is also part of my learning and development work, so there is no formal support commitment for external users.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any suspected vulnerabilities to `security@mx-mail.io`, or open a GitHub issue if email is not an option. Include as much detail as possible (affected prompt file, reproduction steps, and potential impact) so I can investigate quickly.
